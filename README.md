There are two phases in this project, Phase1 and Phase2. 
Phase1 contains Wrapper.py which houses the entire code for Phase1. To run it simply type the following- python2.7 Wrapper.py

Phase2 contains Train.py, Test.py and Wrapper.py
We have not written code in Wrapper.py as the same functionality is there in Test.py. If you want to test the pre-compiled model then it can be found at this URL - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_vOe9qSnp5OhLtx011EbEHwV-OCbyQWr. Download the model and give its path while running Test.py using argument parser functionality.  

To run Train.py type- python2.7 Train.py
To run Test.py type- python2.7 Test.py (type --help to see more options on how to give model path)
